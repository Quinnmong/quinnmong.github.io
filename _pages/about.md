I’m a Computer Science and Business Administration student at Yonsei University, Seoul, with a passion for data-driven decision-making and quantitative finance. My goal is to merge technology with finance to develop innovative solutions, from algorithmic trading strategies to predictive models.

What I Do
======
I’ve gained hands-on experience at Galaxy Digital and Access Ventures, where I worked on optimizing trading strategies, analyzing startup markets, and building AI models for sustainability reports. I’m skilled in Python, predictive modeling, time-series analysis, and financial tools like derivatives pricing.

Beyond Tech
======
When I’m not immersed in coding or finance, you’ll likely find me playing poker, hiking through nature, or hitting the tennis courts. I also love hosting events and connecting with people from all walks of life.

Let’s connect!
